What is Redux?

redux is state management system for cross component or app-wide state.
complex state management system and prop driling also we can stop.

local state (useState/useReducer)
cross component state 
app wide state

redux and context api used to solve problem od cross component state management

react context vs redux
props chain and prop driling we can reduce with this.

state management became complex with context api.

performance is slow in context so for low frequency changes we can use context api

redux is flux architecture

how redux works?

redux is all about having one central data store.

we use reducer function to change data in store.

components dispatch actions

what is flux and what is MVC.

what is pure function

pure function return same output for same set of inputs always.

react.memo() it is different from useMemo()
